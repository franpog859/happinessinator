# Happinessinator

While having fun with Kubernetes and its CI infractructure called Prow I found a very [interesting API](https://thecatapi.com/) with a lot of cats inside! First what came to my mind was obviously Happinessinator and its infinite cats. It was also a good option to jump into Flutter technology I wanted to try for about a year.
